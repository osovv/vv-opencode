## <small>0.35.13 (2026-06-14)</small>

### Summary

This release introduces interview UX guardrails to the vv-spec module, adding a roadmap preview, per-section progress markers, honest depth estimates that expand rather than limit context, and a standardized question-card format with per-section recap. These changes make decision-tree walks more transparent and predictable while ensuring critical forks are never skipped. Additionally, the project metadata is polished with an MIT LICENSE, live CI/coverage badges, and aligned repository topics for improved discoverability.
